This application is meant to calculate the hours needed per day to achieve your study goals. 
Multiple strategies can be created from the main list view and strategies can be customized or deleted based on your preference.

To launch the application Please run 'npm install' followed by 'npm start' in the terminal and then connect to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

The CSS is pretty rudimentary but the applicaiton itself should function properly and give you an accurate number of hours to study per day to achieve your goals by a certain date.
